The defensive ones are “Trade for as much untyped AC, doubled when using a single Light or 1h weapon” and “Trade for twice as many temporary hit points. Thrice if using a shield.”

Feats that require them require nothing instead.

Improved Unarmed Strike
Baseline for everyone with at least 1 BAB. Feats that require it require BAB 1+.
